PCDS
====
Home for PCDS Python Documentation

In an effort to modernize the PCDS Python infrastructure we are embracing a
number of new community software packages; ``Conda``, ``Git``, ``Python 3.x``
etc. The adoption of these tools gives a new chance to standardize the
development workflow that we use for our Python tools. The purpose of this site
is to cleanly describe the general use cases of these tools and how they apply
to PCDS directly.
